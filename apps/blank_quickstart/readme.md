# Blank Applications

![microchip](https://microchip-mplab-harmony.github.io/gfx/APPS%20GFX%20blank_quickstart_screen.png)

This demonstration provides a starting point to integrate a third-party graphics library with MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite.

## Configurations

* [blank_qs_mzda_intddr_sk_meb2_wqvga.X](blank_qs_e70_xu_tm4301b/readme.md) - This application runs on the PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit attached to the Multimedia Expansion Board II using GLCD peripheral display controller to drive the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module with maXTouch® Technology. 

* [blank_qs_mzda_intddr_sk_meb2_wqvga_freertos.X](blank_qs_mzda_intddr_sk_meb2_wqvga_freertos/readme.md) - This application runs on the PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with Stacked DRAM (DA) Starter Kit attached to the Multimedia Expansion Board II using GLCD peripheral display controller to drive the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module with maXTouch® Technology. 

* [blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga.X](blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga/readme.md) - This application runs on the PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with External DRAM (DA) Starter Kit attached to the Multimedia Expansion Board II using GLCD peripheral display controller to drive the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module with maXTouch® Technology. 

* [blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga_freertos.X](blank_qs_mzda_extddr_sk_meb2_wqvga_freertos/readme.md) - This application runs on the PIC32MZ Embedded Graphics with External DRAM (DA) Starter Kit attached to the Multimedia Expansion Board II using GLCD peripheral display controller to drive the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module with maXTouch® Technology. 

* [blank_qs_mzef_cu_wqvga.X](blank_qs_mzef_cu_wqvga/readme.md) - This application runs on the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board using LCC software display controller to drive the High-Performance 4.3" WQVGA Display Module with maXTouch® Technology.

* [blank_qs_e70_xu_tm4301b.X](blank_qs_e70_xu_tm4301b/readme.md) - This application runs on the SAM E54 Curiosity Ultra Development Board using external ILI9488 controller to drive the maXTouch® Curiosity Pro Board via the GFX multi-purpose interface card.

* [blank_qs_e54_cult_cpro_spi.X](blank_qs_e54_cult_cpro_spi/readme.md) - This application runs on the SAM E54 Curiosity Ultra Development Board with a 24-bit pass-through GFX interface card and a maXTouch® Curiosity Pro Board.
