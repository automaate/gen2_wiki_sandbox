# Legato Graphics Library

Legato is designed to produce consistent output on all output hardware while taking advantage of hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the PIC32MZ DA).

The Legato API provides operations providing everything you need to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on Microchip based embedded systems.

Legato is implemented as a library written in the C programming language.

Legato is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the [software agreement](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/blob/master/mplab_harmony_license.md).
