Welcome to MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite Docs!

Here you'll find documentation for MPLAB Harmony Graphics Suite, a MPLAB Harmony graphics software development module for Microchip PIC32 and SAM devices.

Documentation for the Suite is in two forms: [Reference manual](https://automaate.github.io/gen2_wiki_sandbox/docs/legato/html/index.html) and [Wiki](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/gfx/wiki).

The reference manual is intended to provide all necessary information about the Suite on a release by release basis. It contains development topics, application information, and application programming interface. The purpose of the Wiki is provide dynamic solution driven documentation and feedback in a release independent manner. It contains how-to guides and step-by-step tutorials.

**Documentation Archives** - Archive for documentation on previous Aria-based graphics releases are located here: [Aria graphics](https://automaate.github.io/gen2_wiki_sandbox/docs/aria/html/index.html) files.
