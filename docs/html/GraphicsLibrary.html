Graphics Library</h1>
<p>Graphics rendering is made available through the a graphic library. MPLAB Microchip Graphics Suite uses a graphics library to render a designed user interface and handle user events. While third-party libraries can be support, the Suite is integrated with the default Legato graphics library.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
Legato Graphics Library</h2>
<p>Legato is a free source 2D graphics library which provides common APIs that work across Microchip PIC32 and SAM devices. It serves as the graphics engine for many examples and demonstrations in each release as well as many customer designs.</p>
<ul>
<li>a simple but powerful user tool</li>
<li>customizable to the needs of the application</li>
<li>light and flexible with regards to resource consumption</li>
<li>easily extensible to meet future design needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Legato features multiple technologies for creating user interfaces. The Suite is released with many examples to demonstrate the capabilites of the Legato library.</p>
<p>The following sections provide brief introductions to the available technologies for creating user interfaces on PIC32 an SAM devices.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Layers - The graphics library may support multi-layer hardware platforms. The layers help separate UI components onto individual rendering surfaces of a display controller.</h3>
<p>User interface layers serve several functions. They function as the root parent for widgets, they directly correspond to hardware layers in the graphics driver. Layer management is handled by display drivers and not by Legato.</p>
<p>In the simplest case the hardware supports a single layer that is the same dimension as the physical display. More advanced cases may have several layers.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
Screens – The root node of a widget tree. Represents a discrete configuration of layers and widgets. Can have a unique life cycle for custom memory management.</h3>
<p>A screen is defined as the logical root of the user interface scene. Its direct descendants are always one or more layers, as seen in the above diagram. Its size always matches the physical dimensions of the display device used.</p>
<p>The life cycle of a screen can be configured to better manage run-time memory usage. The relevant options are:</p>
<p>Persistent – By default screens will create their widget tree when shown and will free the memory consumed by their widget tree when they are hidden. A screen that is marked as persistent will not free their widget tree when hidden. This allows widgets in a screen to maintain their state when the screen is no longer visible. The downside is that more heap memory is consumed.</p>
<p>Create At Startup – By default screens are only created when they are shown thus keeping run-time memory usage to a minimum. However, the application may want to access widgets in a screen before it is shown for the first time. This option will cause the screen to allocate all of its memory when the screen is first added to the user interface library context. <br  />
</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
Orientation</h4>
<p>Because the hardware and its drivers support dynamic orthogonal orientation, screens can take advantage of this feature. Thus, screens have the option to set a magnitude of rotation to some factor of 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Scene Rendering</p>
<p>The widget tree is a logical representation of the state of the user interface. The library must be capable of transforming this information into a visual representation that can be sent to the graphics display. The individual widgets contain the algorithms necessary to render themselves but Legato is responsible for telling the widgets when to render themselves. This is known as the ‘paint loop’</p>
<p>The library is responsible for evaluating the widget tree to detect widgets that indicate invalid visual states and managing the redraw. It is essential that widgets only redraw when necessary to avoid needlessly consuming processing resources. It is also important that the library not attempt to draw too much at once as that may starve the rest of the application.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md63"></a>
Schemes – A list of colors that can be referenced for drawing purposes. Schemes in Legato are simply collections of colors with given names. If a scheme is assigned to a widget then that scheme will be referenced by that widget during rendering. Legato has an internal scheme that all widgets use by default in the event that a scheme is not assigned.</h3>
<p>Below is a list of scheme colors and a description of how it is often used. There is no restriction on how a widget references a scheme. The color names are merely a recommendation.</p>
<p>Scheme Colors </p><pre class="fragment">Base – Default area fill
Highlight – Light embossing
Highlight Light – Very light embossing
Shadow – Dark embossing
Shadow Dark – Very dark embossing
Foreground – A foreground color
Foreground Inactive – Foreground color when inactive
Foreground Disabled – Foreground color when disabled
Background – A background color, usually to differentiate from Base
Background Inactive – Background when inactive
Background Disabled – Background when disabled
Text – Text color
Text Highlight – Text color background when highlighted
Text Highlight Text – Text color when highlighted
Text Inactive – Text color when inactive
Text Disabled – Text color when disabled
</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md64"></a>
Widgets – An abstract object that is part of a user interface. Each widget belongs to a widget tree.</h3>
<p>A widget is an abstract representation of an object in the user interface. In its most basic form it is a rectangle that is capable of drawing a border, a background color, and containing child widgets. More specific implementations extend the basic widget implementation to provide advanced functionality.</p>
<p>The Legato library relies on function pointers to take advantage of some object oriented programming concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.</p>
<p>Widgets are typically created by calling their specific “new” function. For instance: “leWidget_New()” will allocate a new basic widget and return a pointer to it (similar to calling new in C++). Calling this function will automatically initialize the widget by calling the constructor for that widget. Deleting widgets is done through the use of the function “leWidget_Delete()”.</p>
<p>Widgets can then be added to layers or other widgets as desired.</p>
<p>Edit Widgets</p>
<p>Edit widgets are a special class of widget that inherits from the EditWidget base implementation instead of Widget. These widgets are capable of becoming the active “edit” widget which means that they will receive any edit events raised by a widget capable of issuing edit events, such as a key pad.</p>

<p>The widget tree is a logical representation of the state of the user interface. The library must be capable of transforming this information into a visual representation that can be sent to the graphics display. The individual widgets contain the algorithms necessary to render themselves but Legato is responsible for telling the widgets when to render themselves. This is known as the ‘paint loop’</p>

It is also important that the library not attempt to draw too much at once as that may starve the rest of the application.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md65"></a>
Widget Tree Management</h3>
<p>The widget tree is a tree data structure comprised primarily of widgets. At its root is a screen object. Each of the screen object’s direct children is a layer object. Any descendants of a layer are widgets.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md66"></a>
Heterogeneous Space</h3>
<p>When dealing with objects in a tree it is helpful to understand objects do not live in the same coordinate space as their ancestors or descendants. Each level of the tree represents a unique area of spatial coordinates with the root coordinate space, or the screen space, being the physical space of the display device. Each space is a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate system in both the positive and negative directions.</p>
<p>For example, assume a widget is a child of a root which is a child of a screen. The screen position is (0,0) in physical space. The root position is (20,20). Widget 1 is at (20,20) and widget 2 is at (20,20). All of these coordinates aside from the screen are relative. Each widget is (20,20) offset from its parent. However, Widget 2 is not at (20,20) in physical space, it’s actually (60,60). In global space each space builds on its parent, but it’s entirely relative.</p>
<p>Using a tree to manage the logical state of a user interface provides numerous benefits. </p><pre class="fragment">Position Inheritance – Child coordinate systems logically inherit from their parents but are not directly affected by them. Thus, if some ancestor changes position in its space, children likewise change overall position but their positions in their relative space do not change. This allows for easy manipulation of large portions of the user interface through very small changes.
Intelligent Rendering – The tree structure allows for fast analysis of widget states when determining how and when to render the overall scene. Nodes in the tree track changes in the states of widgets and their descendants. This allows the library to use intelligent methods to cull portions of the user interface to avoid the processing overhead of redrawing widgets that have not changed.
Effect Propagation – As with coordinate propagation, effects can also be inherited along tree branches. For instance, if some node in the tree is made invisible, all descendants are also made invisible. If a node is made partially transparent, then that transparency is propagated to all descendant nodes.

Fonts - Fonts are collections of bitmaps. They are composed of a style, strings, and glyphs. They are managed by the Font Asset tool. A project uses one or more fonts for all textual data.</h3>
<p>Fonts are stored in internal flash.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md68"></a>
Unicode support</h4>
<p>LittlevGL supports UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters. You need to configure your editor to save your code/text as UTF-8.</p>
<p>There are several installed fonts in different sizes. Usersset bold, italic or anti-alias style properties.</p>
<p>Special features</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md69"></a>
Images - The graphics library may support reading, decompression, and rendering of JPEG, PNG, and RAW, image formats.</h3>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md70"></a>
Events – An indication of some kind of occurrence that may require attention. Event Management</h3>
<p>Event Management</p>
<p>The Legato state maintains an internal list of events that must get serviced frequently. This is done by called by "<a class="el" href="legato__state_8h.html#aef7def9e4241d753aae63092a72f29f0" title="Shutdown Legato library.">leUpdate()</a>”. This is known as the ‘update loop’.</p>
<p>The Legato state maintains an internal list of events that must get serviced frequently. This is done by called by "<a class="el" href="legato__state_8h.html#aef7def9e4241d753aae63092a72f29f0" title="Shutdown Legato library.">leUpdate()</a>”. This is known as the ‘update loop’.</p>
<p>Input Handling</p>
<p>The user interface library has no knowledge of existing hardware but it must provide the means for the user to interact with the scene. Legato thus provides several generic APIs to allow any source to inject input events into the system. These events are stored in the internal event list and are handled during the next update phase. <br  />
